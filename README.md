# Description

This course provides a practical introduction to the writing of
Python programs for the complete novice. Participants are lead
through the core aspects of Python illustrated by a series of
example programs. Upon completion of the course, attentive
participants will be able to write simple Python programs from
scratch and to customize more complex code to fit their needs.

# Pre-course information (IMPORTANT!)

Before the course begins, you need to install python and the necessary
libraries on your laptop or you won't be able to run your code.
Please follow the installation instructions [here](precourse).

# Visiting hours/E-mail hours

Teaching is not my main gig, so I will be answering your questions (outside of classes, of course) at a fixed time,
every Friday from 10AM to 11AM. You are welcome to come to my office at that time, which is located at 2B:586 in the B-house.

For similar reasons, I will be answering e-mails that I received during the week at that same time, give or take.

# Course Content

During this course, you will learn about:

* Core concepts about Python syntax: Data types, blocks and indentation, variable scoping, iteration, functions, methods and arguments
* Different ways to control program flow using loops and conditional tests
* Regular expressions and pattern matching
* Writing functions and best-practice ways of making them usable
* Reading from and writing to files
* Python libraries for scientific computation
* Python libraries for plotting

# Learning Objectives

After this course you should be able to:

* Edit and run Python code
* Write file-processing python programs that produce output to the terminal and/or external files.
* Create stand-alone python programs to process biological data
* Know how to develop your skills in Python after the course (including debugging)
