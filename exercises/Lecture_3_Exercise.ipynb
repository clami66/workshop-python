    "Blocket is a Swedish site for buying or selling things, much like eBay. In the file `blocket_listings.txt` you will find a list of ads that has been put up on the site. You can download the file from [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clami66/workshop-python/0422/downloads/blocket_listings.txt) (`right click -> Save link as`) and save it in the same folder as this notebook. If you save it elsewhere, you will have to fix the path accordingly when you `open()` the file!\n",
